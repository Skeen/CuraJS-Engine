This branch holds a JavaScript compilation for CuraEngine (legacy) using Emscripten.

See 'releases' for compilation output.

CuraEngine
==========
The CuraEngine is a C++ console application for 3D printing GCode generation. It has been made as a better and faster alternative to the old Skeinforge engine.

For more information see: https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine

License
=======
CuraEngine is released under terms of the AGPLv3 License.
Terms of the license can be found in the LICENSE file. Or at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html

But in general it boils down to: You need to share the source of any CuraEngine modifications if you make an application with the CuraEngine. (Even if you make a web-based slicer, you still need to share the source!)
